						<h2>About</h2>
						<p> Blending the worlds of alternative and bass music, Strocksu is an embodiment of what it means to be human. Stephen Strocksu brings new meaning to storytelling by creating a world meant to show the power of being one’s self through powerful drops and even more powerful breakdowns, both of which evoke a sense of belonging in whatever world the listener dwells.

With a heavy focus on melody and flow, Strocksu is overcoming the limitations of what it means to be a bass artist in the 21st century by breaking out of the conventional box of sound design and club sounds, instead bringing a more tasteful and relatable message of finding peace through one’s own mistakes and shortcomings.</p>
